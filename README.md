Tic Tac Toe Repository

The basis of our program is to run a game of Tic-Tac-Toe. We create a 2D array of strings to serve as our board for the game,
and then take turn-based user input to update the status of the playing board.

Running the code:

Compile with:
    g++ -std=c++17 TicTacToe.cpp -o TicTacToe

Execute with:
    ./TicTacToe

Playing game:
    Follow the instructions in the game, where each user will take turns inputting what location they want to make their turn on.
    Note: The valid locations are 0-8, and simply correspond to the indices of a 2D array (indexed at 0).
